PHSideScrollingImagePicker
==========================

A horizontally image picker, similar to the one found in iOS 7's Photos.app share view.

Written using auto layout to demonstrate how to do floating elements in a scroll view, but may also be useful to anyone who just wants that iOS 7 image picker look. There's no ALAssetLibrary integration on purpose â€“ You'll need to bring that yourself.
