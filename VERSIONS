# 1.1
- Rewrote most internals to function as a collection view. This moves the project away from being an auto layout example and being more production ready. Unfortunately auto layout doesn't yet play well with UICollectionViewLayout.

# 1.0.1
- Fixed a small alignment bug where the selection view wasn't inset on the left side.

# 1.0.0
â€“ Initial Release
